# Currency

Currency provides API services for currency. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites

* [go (latest version)](https://golang.org/dl/)
* [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep)
* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

### Installing

#### 1. Setting GOPATH

The GOPATH environment variable specifies the location of your [workspace](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces). 
If no GOPATH is set, it is assumed to be $HOME/go on Unix systems and %USERPROFILE%\go on Windows. 
If you want to use a custom location as your workspace, you can set the GOPATH environment variable.

Please refer [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH) for setting up GOPATH

```
go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep
```

#### 3. cd to golang workspace/src

```
cd $GOPATH/src
```

#### 4. clone repo
